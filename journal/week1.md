# Week 1 — Homework and Challenges

 After watching the videos, including the live webinar i attended, I have completed the tasks as follow:
 - Setting up the Docker - I had some issues bringing up docker compose up. There was ‘port already in use’ error even after bringing down the composer. I was able to terminate the compose using the ID. The overall setting was fairly ok.
- Create the Notification Feature (Backend and Front) – this was not difficult as I already has experience with full-stack software development.  The overall configuration is shown bellow:

 - DynamoDB and Postgres Configuration – this was task was not difficult. There were some issues setting up Postgres. But, I was able to resolve the issues and integrate the databases in docker-compose yalm file. 
## Final Tought on First week.
This week was fairly ok in terms of difficulty. Some of the issues with the databases needed some minor fixes. Can’t wait to get next week tasks.
