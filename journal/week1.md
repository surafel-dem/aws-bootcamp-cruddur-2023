# Week 1 — Homework and Challenges

 After watching the videos, including the live webinar i attended, I have completed the tasks as follow:
 - Setting up the Docker - I had some issues bringing up docker compose up. There was ‘port already in use’ error even after bringing down the composer. I was able to terminate the compose using the ID. The overall setting was fairly ok.
- Create the Notification Feature (Backend and Front) – this was not difficult as I already has experience with full-stack software development.  The overall configuration is shown bellow:
