 # Week 0 — Homework and Challenges
 
 After watching the videos, including the live webinar i attended, I have completed the tasks as follow:
 - Recreating the Conceptual and logical Architectual Diagrams using  Lucid Charts or on a Napkin.
   The conceptual diagram was done on a napkin as shown bellow

   Additionally the logical architectural diagram was developed using lucid app as shown on the following link:

   The recreation of the logical diagram was great as it enables me to dig into the different shapes available:

   I have also created a logical digram showing the CI/CP Pipeline

 - Create an Admin User & Use CloudShell	
   The second part of the assignment was creating admin user for the boorcamp. I have created an admin user with the necessary security recommendations such as MFA authentication. 
   
 - Generate AWS Credentials & Install AWS CLI
   AWS CLI was already installed on my machine. On the other hand i set up Gitpod account and updated 'gitpod.yaml' file as suggested on Andrews video.

 - Create a Billing Alarm & Budget
   Finally, i set up a billing and budget alarm. This was crucial as the project focused on working on a free tier account.
