 # Week 0 — Homework and Challenges
 
 After watching the videos, including the live webinar i attended, I have completed the tasks as follow:
 - Recreating the Conceptual and logical Architectual Diagrams using  Lucid Charts or on a Napkin.
   The conceptual diagram was done on a napkin as shown bellow

   Additionally the logical architectural diagram was developed using lucid app as shown on the following link:

   The recreation of the conceptual diagram was great as it enables me to dig into the different shapes available:
   
 - Create an Admin User & Use CloudShell	
 - Generate AWS Credentials & Install AWS CLI
 - Create a Billing Alarm & Budget
