# Week 3 — Decentralized Authentication

In Week 3, we focused on Decentralized Authentication, which was my favorite part of the bootcamp so far (but the more difficult and the one that help me learn even more). We learned how to provision using Amazon #Cognito User Pool. We also learned how to implement API calls to Amazon Coginto for custom login, signup, recovery and forgot password page. Andrew Brown was the main instructors and as always, he provided us with a step-by-step guidance on the implementation. The challenging part of the week was verifying JWT Token from server side to serve authenticated API endpoints in Flask Application.

The main objectives & tasks of week 3 includes:
- Setup Cognito User Pool.
- Implement Custom Signin, Signup and Recovery pages
- Verify JWT token server side

# Week 3 — Homework and Challenges
The assignments and tasks for this week were more chllanging compared to previous once. The JWT Token verification was the one that took me more time to resolve some issues. But it's great as i was able to learn and work on my debugging skills. I was able to register going through recovery page as well.
